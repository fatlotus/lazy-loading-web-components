  <h1>What is going on?</h1>
  <p>The two WebComponents below were loaded dynamically.</p>
  <my-square></my-square>
  <my-circle></my-circle>
  <h2>What is this trickery?</h2>
  <p>Right now, the community seems to be coalescing around the use of Bower to
     statically import and "vulcanize" the custom elements being used in a page.
     To get a Material Design button, for example, one must run:</p>
  <pre>$ bower install --save PolymerElements/paper-button`</pre>
  <p>and then import:</p>
  <pre>&lt;link rel="import" href="bower_components/paper-button/paper-button.html"&gt;</pre>
  <p>for each component you plan to use on a page. Using dynamic loading, 
     however, there is just a single import to get the entire suite.</p>
  <pre>&lt;link rel="import" href="my-library.html"&gt;</pre>
  <h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
  <p>It's easier to use, but more importantly, it allows for the creation of
     much larger catalogs of elements. Imagine an NPM, but for HTML elements 
     &emdash; where you can customize code, and then copy and paste into your
     page, without downloads, imports, or tweaks.</p>
